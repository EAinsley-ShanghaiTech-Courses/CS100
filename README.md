# CS100

CS100 is the first programming course on C/C++ the student will take. After getting A+ on this course, I became a Teaching Assistant(TA) for this course, and have been selected as the outstanding TA of the year. I didn't keep the requirements and the code templates, so most of the code cannot run because lack of supporting files.
